# What-I-like-_-
Basically the itty bitty is my skin is my current fixation, it flip flops so I’m not always in a consistent fandom.

I like things like FNaF. DSaF, 1D, DC, Ghostbusters and the scream series. Honestly, there is a lot more I enjoy. 

I usually stick to kins, or well characters I just muse, I don't care if doubles interact at all bc in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't mmatter.
